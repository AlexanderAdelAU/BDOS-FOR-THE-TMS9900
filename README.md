# BDOS-FOR-THE-TMS9900
A Disk Operating System for the TMS9900 based on CP/M Interfaces

This is a BDOS for the TMS9900 based on CP/M it does not implement the full function set but is very functional.  It makes use
of the MONITOR programme for its basic IO and Disc functions.

It uses standard IBM Double Density 3.5" Disc but could easily be ported to a Flash Drive etc.
