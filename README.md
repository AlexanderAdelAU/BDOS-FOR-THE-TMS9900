# CP/M BDOS-FOR-THE-TMS9900
This is a minimal Disk Operating System for the TMS9900 based on CP/M Interfaces

This is a BDOS for the TMS9900 based on CP/M it does not implement the full function set but is very suitable for small systems and works
very well with the TMS9900 Small C compiler in the repository.  It makes use of the MONITOR programme for its basic IO and Disc functions.

It uses standard IBM Double Density 3.5" Disc but could easily be ported to a Flash Drive etc.

BDOS supports the following function at the moment:
